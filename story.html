        <p>
          I was born in Algeria, and I am part of an ethnic group indigenous to
          Kabylia in North Africa. I grew up listening to hip-hop and even tried
          breakdancing while I was in middle school. By the time I reached high
          school, I was a full-time rock-n-roll fan. I’ve also always had an
          interest in computer programming and algorithmic thinking. To me, it
          seems like the most efficient way to go about life (there is a great
          book on this called Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom
          Griffiths). For a brief stint I even tried studying C programming
          language, but I wasn’t able to stick with it at the time. So what am I
          up to now?</br>
          </br>
          There’s this saying, “We see a reflection of ourselves in
          the world.” I often understand the world around me by looking at how I
          feel during a specific moment in time. In 2015, I graduated from Batna
          University with a degree in Environmental Engineering. I felt like
          something was missing. I kept thinking that there’s a much bigger
          world out there and the only way to really explore it is to take a
          leap of faith. That fall, I decided it was time to pursue the dreams I
          had put on hold and moved over 4,000 miles to the United States to
          make them happen.</br> </br>
          I’ve been in the U.S. for almost three years now.
          Most of that time has been spent learning English, meeting some pretty
          incredible people, and trying foods I never knew existed. As the years
          went by, I knew there was more I wanted to accomplish. But I started
          thinking of this experience as an investment. Everyday I sat in an
          English language course or found my way round the city, I was learning
          something new that would ultimately help me achieve my bigger goals.
          From the little things, like learning how to swipe a metrocard on the
          Subway, to the bigger ones, like learning the ins and outs of a new
          culture, I’ve slowly but surely found my way. I now speak Algerian
          Arabic, French, and English. Next up, I’m finally learning the
          language of the machine (kinda… there’s a middleman or more accurately
          a middle program, compilers). For the past couple of months I’ve been
          studying full-stack development with Code Immersives at the Digital
          Film Academy. Everything is all about algorithm-this and
          algorithm-that (in reference to the two movies: Analyze this, and
          Analyze that.)... I feel like I'm finally on the right path.</br></br>
          One of
          the biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is how little I actually knew.
          I think it is a universal experience: to think you know a lot about
          something only to realize you hadn’t even scratched the surface yet.
          Once you start educating yourself, reading books, and reaching out to
          others this whole other world opens up about the matter at hand. And
          while it’s jarring at first to realize how much you have left to
          learn, I think it’s okay to confront that setback and recognize the
          doubts it brings with it. I’ve found that those low points often come
          right before a breakthrough, allowing you to gain a little confidence
          that will eventually accumulate. I thrive on new challenges and look
          forward to the next ones, where I can code my way through and sculpt a
          new path.</br></br>
          On a personal level, I want to learn and grow from my
          challenges, big and small. And I want to try to understand myself and
          figure out who I’ll become. On a larger level, I think we all have a
          duty to our societies and that our ultimate purpose is to contribute
          to and thrive in them. Now that I’m here and finally back on track, I
          hope to grow as a member of the community I live in and code some
          really cool stuff.
